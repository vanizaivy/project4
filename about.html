                    Grounded' is a smart bin, designed to encourage New Zealanders to essentially 'reduce, reuse and recycle' by earning points and rewards.

                    It works you, the user, disposing your rubbish into one of the Grounded bin. Once it's been disposed in the bin, a QR code will appear in the screen above the rubbish slot. Primarily, you will have installed the app and created an account. You will then open the camera on the app and scan the QR code.

                    Depending on the type of weight of the waste, you will earn points that you can the convert into New Zealand dollars. You can either spend these money by shopping in the Marketplace or donate to any organizations you please.

                    This system will not only motivate citizens to recycle but it will also promote environmental awareness in a collaborative way.                  </p>

                          When it comes to rubbish, for most people it truly is a case of ‘out of sight, out of mind’. But in order to minimise your impact on the environment, waste management needs to be made smarter. And there’s only so much that waste management organisations, engineering and breakthroughs in new technology can do.

With the high volume of waste that materials recovery facilities have to process, it is simply unviable for workers to sort through every item coming through. To ensure that recycled materials are being recycled and that hazardous materials are in no risk of causing a dangerous fire, it is essential to carefully sort through your waste to ensure that all of your waste is going exactly where it should be.

Smart bins are organised by Paper, Plastic, Glass, Cans and Landfills. To ensure you are contributing great choices to the environment, make sure to dispose your trash in the right bin.
